4.7.2023: I added a new delegate ProgressStatusCallback that can be passed into the LoadDataTablesData method
to receive callbacks during long operations.

4.1.2023: DataJuggler.Net7 is a port of earlier versions of this project. All new development
is performed on this version until .NET8 is released later this year.
DataJuggler.Net7 is used to read SQL Server database schema using SQLDatabaseConnector.cs, and also 
has code generation features using CSharpClassWriter.cs.

DataJuggler.Net 7 powers the following projects

DB Compare
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DBCompare

DB Compare reads the database schema and compares two SQL Server databases and displays a report
of any schema differences. The generate scripts feature is a work in progress.

Another project that uses this and is open source is:

DataJuggler.Excelerate
https://github.com/DataJuggler/Excelerate

Nuget DataJuggler.Excelerate

Live Demo
https://excelerate.datajuggler.com

Code Generate C# Classes From Excel Header Rows

Blazor Source Code For Above Site

Blazor Excelerate

https://github.com/DataJuggler/Blazor.Excelerate

And my latest project is SQL Snapshot

Nuget DataJuggler.SQLSnapshot
https://github.com/DataJuggler/SQLSnapshot

Export an entire SQL Server database to Excel including all rows with 3 lines of code.

Another site that is powered by an earlier version of DataJuggler.Net7 is, and is my favorite project.

DataTier.Net
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DataTier.Net

DataTier.Net is an Entity Framework alternative that uses all stored procedures.

If you feel any of the projects are worth the price of free, please leave a star on Git Hub and / or
